1. If a pull request template exists in .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file, always follow it!
2. If the template has a line like "Issue: https://bitmovin.atlassian.net/browse/PI-<number>" (can be other than PI), replace "PI-<number>" from the current git branch name by fining the pattern of "PROJECT-NUMBER" after the prefix "feature/" in the branch name.
3. Pull requests should ALWAYS BE CREATED AS A DRAFT unless explicitly asked otherwise!!!
