# IMPORTANT RULES TO FOLLOW
1. Before using `git` command line tool, consider using git MCP tools first if there is an appropriate tool. If using git commands directly in terminal, use with `--no-pager` argument like `git --no-pager <command>` to avoid interactive mode.

2. When committing changes for source code files, ALWAYS have a trailing empty line in the content of the file!
