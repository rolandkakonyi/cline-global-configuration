TaskRef: "Add MCP Specification link to MCP development guides"

Learnings:
- Successfully updated `Rules/mcp-server-development-protocol.md` by adding a link to the MCP Specification in the "Further Documentation" section.
- Successfully updated `Rules/mcp-client-development-guide.md` by adding a link to the MCP Specification in the "Next steps" section.
- Used `replace_in_file` tool for precise modifications in both Markdown files.

Difficulties:
- None encountered.

Successes:
- Both guides now correctly reference the official MCP specification document.
- Changes were applied accurately as planned.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When creating or updating technical documentation that refers to a standard or protocol, always ensure a direct link to the latest official specification document is included. This provides users with a canonical source for detailed information.
